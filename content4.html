        <p class="description">Sertanejo originated in the rural area of central Brazil - primarily in the states of São Paulo, Paraná, Minas Gerais, Goias, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul. It consists of romantic ballads, and/or stories about rural life and struggles - but it is also popular dance music.</p>

                    <li class="artists-info"><label>About:</label> It was through a mutual friend in 2005 that Jorge and Mateus had the chance to sing together. The chemistry was so strong that they began performing as a duo. Their first show was on May 26, 2005, at a nightclub in Itumbiara (a city in Goiás).

                        The duo then recorded a CD in Mateus's garage, featuring some of their compositions and new versions of classic sertanejo songs. In 2007, their first official work, the CD/DVD “Ao Vivo Em Goiânia,” was released by Universal Music.</li>
