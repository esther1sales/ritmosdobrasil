 <h1 class="titlesgenre2">MARACATU</h1>
        <h1 class="titlesgenreyellow2">MARACATU</h1>
        <p class="description">Maracatu is a type of secular Afro-Brazilian music. In this genre, a folk song is called a toada. The lyrics are usually a mixture of Portuguese and Yoruba languages.
            The toadas with dancing, chants, and poetry mark the Maracatu Nação’s carnival culture. The main instruments used in Maracatu are the wooden alfaia drum, tarol snare drums, gonguê bells, and the African shekeres.</p>

Their music leaves us with that feeling of discovering something new and vibrant, something that suddenly makes perfect sense. With Brazilian popular culture as their guiding star and fluid boundaries, the group blends funk, forró, brega, maracatu, and whatever else comes their way. The result is a harmonious, intense, danceable, and explosive chaos, but above all, unmistakably Brazilian.
