    <p class="intro">
      Brazil, known for its tropical landscapes, fun memes, and delightful cuisine, has already captivated the world with its passionate people and diverse cultural backgrounds. Brazilian music portrays these traits using light, melodic, poetic, and romantic rhythms. Even though Brazil now has a beautiful collection of rhythms, the country's music scene also exposes the cruel and sad history that resulted in its diversity, achieved through centuries of exploration, abuse, and neglect.
