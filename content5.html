        <p class="description">Samba isn’t only one of the world’s most common dance routines, but it also happens to be a classic Brazilian music style. The roots of the Samba trace back to the West African slave trade. The African melodies intertwined with folk Bahian music to create the Samba de Roda that we know today.
            The most stand-out feature of this captivating music is its electrifying rhythm. That’s why percussionists are the centerpiece in any Samba performance. </p>

  <h1 class="titlesgenre2">STRONDA</h1>
  <h1 class="titlesgenreyellow2">STRONDA</h1>
  <p class="description">Stronda music is a subgenre of mainstream Brazilian hip hop along with some traces of funk and rock. 
    The singing style in stronda tracks is very similar to rapping. The tempo is usually fast to keep up with electric guitars and heavy drums.
    One of the genre’s leaders is a band called Bonde da Stronda. Their songs have lighthearted lyrics about life and success.</p>
